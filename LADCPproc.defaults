# default parameters for [LADCPproc]

# NOTES:
#	- defaults are taken:
#		1) from my current UH processing merge control files
#		2) from the defaults set in Eric's [merge.c]
#	- the default version in the ANTS bin dir is always loaded
#	- if there is a version in the current processing directory it is loaded 
#	  afterwards
#	- per-station parameters can be chosed based on $LADCP_file and $CTD_file
# 	- for additional notes, see [LADCPproc]

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
# ASCII CTD file support
#----------------------------------------------------------------------

# By default, [LADCPproc] reads a standard seabird .cnv file. Alternatively,
# the CTD data can be supplied in a plain ASCII file. To do so, the following
# variables must be defined in the setup file (-s). Each variable defines 
# the field (column) number of the corresponding data field. Fields are
# numbered beginning with 1.

# $CTD_ASCII_sampfreq		= 1;  ## in Hz

# $CTD_ASCII_press_field 	= 1;
# $CTD_ASCII_temp_field 	= 2;
# $CTD_ASCII_salin_field	= 3;
# $CTD_ASCII_lat_field 		= 4;
# $CTD_ASCII_lon_field 		= 5;

# The following variable is optional.

# $CTD_ASCII_badval 		= 999;

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Backscatter Profile Parameters
#----------------------------------------------------------------------

# The output profile of volume-scattering coefficient is calculated 
# from a subset of the bins only. This is based on the observation,
# from on a single P403 profile, that the volume-scattering coefficient 
# correction of Deines (IEEE 1999) yield similar results only for
# bins 3-9. 

# The seabed-finding routine, on the other hand, uses acoustic 
# backscatter from all bins, as it is possible that the seabed is only
# seen in the farthest bins. 

$Svbin_start = 3;
$Svbin_end	 = 9; 

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Bottom Track Parameters
#----------------------------------------------------------------------

# First bin to consider when looking for seabed to calculated post-
# processed BT. NB: For consistency with EF's code, bin 1 is the 
# first bin.

$BT_bin_start = 1;

# CTD depth above seabed where BT search begins

$BT_begin_search_above = 300;

# Maximum allowed spread of bin number where max echo is found. Large values
# imply sloping seabed and/or large instrument tilt. The default value of
# 3 is probably too tight. The range spread calculation should be modified
# to take instrument tilt into consideration.

$BT_max_bin_spread = 3;

# For tricky BT cases, the acoustic backscatter from the seabed can be plotted
# and the bottom range set manually. This has been found to be very powerful
# in case of 2011_IWISE yoyo profile 160, where the bottom was around 150m 
# from the lower turning points and where the method of Deines [1999] clearly
# does not work.

#$BT_min_depth = xxx;
#$BT_max_depth = xxx;

# Maximum difference between water depth and average distance of echo max.,
# if $BT_min_depth and $BT_max_depth are not set. The stddev of the detected
# water depth is added To this number.

$BT_max_depth_error = 20;

# Maximum allowed difference between reference-layer w and BT w. Note 
# that this must be relaxed in regions of significant near-bottom
# vertical velocity, e.g. due to cross-slope currents.

$BT_max_w_difference = 0.03;

# Shear Processing Parameters
#----------------------------------------------------------------------

##   u_bin0, u_bin1, w_bin0, w_bin1: These set the first and
##      last bin indices used when integrating horizontal and
##      vertical velocity, respectively.  The indices start
##      from 1 and are inclusive.  These parameters do not  
##      affect the calculation of shear.  They should specify
##      a good reference layer (for the calculation of the
##      barotropic component) such as bins 1 to 4.

$wbin_start	= 1;	## These parameters start from 1, not zero
$wbin_end 	= 5;
$ubin_start	= 1;
$ubin_end	= 5;

##   sh_bin0, sh_bin1: These are like the above except that  
##      they affect the shear calculation only.  They can
##      normally be left at the default range of 1 to 128  
##      (disabled).

$shbin_start	= 1;
$shbin_end		= $LADCP{N_BINS};

##   w_ref_bin, w_dif: These control one of the editing  
##      criteria recommended by Fischer and Visbeck, or rather
##      a modification of it.  All velocity data are rejected
##      below the point at which the vertical velocity
##      estimate is w_dif larger or smaller than the estimate
##      in w_ref_bin.  I have not found this criterion
##      helpful.  94/12/22: changed, so that only those points
##      where w actually deviates from the mean from 0 to w_ref_bin
##      are flagged.

$w_ref_bin = 10;
$w_dif	   = 0.05;

##   wake_hd_dif, wake_ang_min, min_wake_w, n_wake_bins:  These control
##      editing based upon the direction and inclination of the package wake,
##      calculated from reference layer U,V, and W.  wake_hd_dif
##      sets how close to the heading of the wake must be to
##      the heading of any beam for interference (in degrees).
##      wake_ang_min sets the minimum wake angle from the
##      vertical for interference (in degrees).  min_wake_w sets
##      the minimum package speed required for wake interference
##      (although upward speed is measured negative, this parameter
##      is input as a positive value).  All three criteria
##      must be satisfied for the wake flag to be set.  n_wake_bins
##      determines how many bins from the top are removed from a
##      flagged profile, the default is 1 (top bin only).
##      Additionally, if the previous ensemble met all
##      interference criteria, the present ensemble
##      will be flagged even if the criteria are not met.
##      Default values are wake_hd_dif=0.0, wake_ang_min=90.0,
##      and min_wake_w=0.1, which results in no wake editing.

$wake_hd_dif  = 0.0;   ## set wake editing defaults so that no wake editing
$wake_ang_min = 90.0;  ## occurs
$min_wake_w	  = 0.1;
$n_wake_bins  = 1;     ## wake editing default - top bin only

##   e_max is the maximum error velocity.  An error velocity
##         greater than e_max will flag the other velocity
##         components.  For the BB with 2-ping ensembles, 0.01
##         m/s looks about right for this parameter.  It
##         knocks out the incorrect ambiguity glitches as well
##         as some smaller but still significant glitches.
##         Note that for the BB, the PG criteria operate on
##         percent 4-beam solutions, so PG combined with the
##         e_max provides a reliable filter against big
##         glitches.
##         For the NB with 18-ping ensembles, it is not yet
##         clear whether there is any benefit in using e_max
##         at all.  To be effective, the value will have to be
##         small, something like 0.015 or 0.02.  Note also
##         that for the NB, the pg array holds pg counting
##         both 4-beam and 3-beam solutions, so 3-beam
##         glitches will slip through the e_max net.
##         Default is e_max= 10.0, which effectively disables
##         it.

$e_max = 0.1;

##   min_correlation (BB only) is the minimum correlation, in
##      counts, for each beam in a given bin.

$min_cor = 70;

##   Shear editing:  This requires 2 passes through the
##      database, one using the option
##            binned_shear_time_range:
##      to set the time range for a pass during which the
##      shear statistics will be calculated on a relatively
##      coarsely grid by binning rather than interpolation,
##      then using the usual option
##            time_range:
##      for the normal pass in which the results of the
##      previous pass can be used to flag bad velocity values
##      based on anomalous shears.  The first pass can include
##      both up and down casts if desired, in which case it
##      would be followed by a second pass for the up and
##      downcasts separately.  The binned shear statistics are
##      saved until they are explicitly recalculated with the
##      "binned_shear_time_range:" option.
##      The shear editing is controlled by these parameters:
##         shear_dev_max= x.x, where x.x is a floating point
##            number giving a threshold in standard
##            deviations.  Any shear component deviating from
##            the binned mean by more than this times the
##            local standard deviation will raise a flag.
##            Suitable values for this parameter are probably
##            in the range 3-5.  Less than 3 is likely to
##            start trimming too many valid samples, more than
##            4 or 5 is likely to do nothing at all.
##         shear_sum_dev_max= x.x gives a threshold used in
##            detecting isolated bad velocity points.  If the
##            sum of two successive bad shears (based on
##            shear_dev_max), divided by the
##            standard deviation, is LESS THAN this amount,
##            then the common velocity point is considered to
##            be an isolated glitch, and it alone is flagged.
##            Otherwise, both velocity samples contributing to
##            a flagged shear will be flagged.  A reasonable
##            value for this parameter is probably around 1-2,
##            but I don't yet have enough experience to be
##            sure.
##         Warning: don't forget to reset the first_x=,
##         first_y=, and first_z= parameters after pass 1
##         (with binned_shear_time_range:).  If you don't, and
##         the depths are not in the database, then the depths
##         will be completely wrong in pass 2 (with
##         time_range:).  You may also want to use a different
##         output file name for pass 1, so that the binned
##         shear statistics file will not be overwritten
##         during pass 2.

$max_shdev     = 3.5;	## to disable, set to nan

##   previous ping bottom bounce interference editing is controlled by:
##   clip_margin 0.0 turns off this editing; otherwise, it is the margin in
##      meters (on each side) by which the calculated range of the
##      interference is expanded before clipping.  A reasonable value would
##      be something like 32 (2 depth bins).

# On DIMES US2 stations in Drake Passage it was found that the ambiguity velocity had been
# set too low. It appears, however, that aliased velocities are easy to detect because aliasing
# causes a large positive velocity to appear as a large negative one, and vice versa.
# The following defines the maximum allowed discrepancy between the vertical velocity from CTD
# pressure and the LADCP reference-layer w. This parameter should probably be set to something
# similar as the ambiguity velocity.
