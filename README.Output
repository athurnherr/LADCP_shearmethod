This README describes the output produced by [LADCPproc] and
[LADCPintsh].


=File Format and Interface with Matlab=

All output files produced by [LADCPproc] and [LADCPintsh] are in a
proprietary undocumented ASCII format, called ANTS. To important and
export ANTS files into and from Matlab, the Matlab_tools are required
(see [README.Install]).

To import the ANTS file <013DL.sh> into Matlab, use

	sh = loadANTS('013DL.sh');

The resulting structure will contain Metadata as scalars and the data
from each field in a suitably named vector.

To export the suitable Matlab structure <binned_sh> as the ANTS file
<013DL.shprof>, use

	struct2ANTS(binned_sh,'013DL.sh','013DL.shprof');

The second argument defines a dependency (the file <013DL.shprof> should
be re-made when <013DL.sh> changes).


=[LADCPproc] Output=

The STDOUT of [LADCPproc] consists of a list of all shear samples ---
essentially a time-depth-series (.tds) of shear values. If this output
is not required, STDOUT can be redirected to /dev/null.

The STDERR of [LADCPproc] consists of the diagnostic output. This output
should be captured into a log file. This is much easier with standard
(bash, Korn, Bourne) shells than with csh derivates.

Additional output is produced with the following options:

	-p 	write a binned shear profile file that can be fed
	        directly to [LADCPintsh] to create a relative
		(baroclinic) velocity profile

	-b	write a bottom-track file that can be fed directly to
	        [LADCPintsh] (-r option) to reference the baroclinic
		velocity profile

	-t	write a time-series file, which is useful primarily for
	  	diagnosing problems with the time-lagging of CTD and
		LADCP data

	-f	write a file with all the velocity editing flags

	-a	write a .dts file of the acoustic backscatter

	-k	write bottom track profiles (as a single file)


=[LADCPintsh] Output=

The STDOUT of [LADCPintsh] consists of a velocity profile created from
the vertically integrated shear and possibly referenced by an external
velocity profile.

The STDERR of [LADCPintsh] consists of minimal diagnostic output.

On -s, additionally the shear profile is written to a file just before
integration. This is primarily useful for combining shear data from
down- and uplooking ADCPs.
